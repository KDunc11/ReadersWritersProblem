# ReadersWritersProblem

Operating Systems class Readers-Writers problem assignment. Used a C# WinForms UI application for the implementation. 

## Project:

Create an application to demonstrate the principle studied. The application(s) will work like this: 

1. Manage a queue of readers and a queue of writers.

2. Opens a file for reading and writing: Note that the file open in read mode must be shareable

3. Writers will write the current time to the file and close the file.

4. Readers will read the time from the file and print it to the console (or UI).
